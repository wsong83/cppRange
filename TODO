Features
        * [High]   Allow throwing exception when some illegal range operation is done. Currently 
                   the result is assigned to empty silently. User may not notice the error, which 
                   may results in misunderstanding or difficulties in debug.
        * [Median] Support infinit boundaries, which is useful for mathematical calculations.
        * [Median] Add support for open/close bound types notation. Currently all boundaries are 
                   assumed close. This is useful for general mathematical calculations.
        * [Low]    Considering support float/double ranges. However, is it really useful when other
                   libraries are dedicated to real ranges. Maybe multidimensional calculation is
                   still missing, but it will be very difficult to do for real ranges.
        
Documentation
        * [Median] Build up a website to explain the library. Currently a README is provided.
        * [Low]    Explain the reasons in creating this library.
        * [Low]    Explain why build the strict order less() is this way and how RangeMap is not 
                   supported.
        * [Low]    Add more user examples.
