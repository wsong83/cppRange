cppRange (1.0)
========

A C++ static multi-dimentional range calculation (interval calculation) library.

This library provides a set of operations on static multi-dimension range expressions.

========
A mult-dimension static range can be expressed as:

1-bit:           [3:3] or [3]         RangeElement / Range / RangeMap
1-dimension:     [3:0]                RangeElement / Range / RangeMap
Multi-dimension: [5:0][2:-1]          Range / RangeMap

* range expression is always expressed as [higher bound : lower bound]. 
  if the lower bound is actually larger than the higher bound, it is illegal, such as [2:3].

Three type of range classes are provided for user:
1. RangeElement
   A single dimension range expression.
   Example: [1:0]
2. Range
   A multidimensional range expression storing ranges described by a single range vector.
   Example: [3:0][5:-2]
3. RangeMap
   A arbitrary multidimensional range expression.
   It can store the union of multiple Range object in a tree structure.
   Therefore, it can be used to store the results of all legal results of 
   multidimensional range calculations.
   Example: 
     [3:0][5:2]                         // a single range vector
     {[3][5:2];[2:1]{[5:2],[0]};[0][0]} // the union of [3:0][5:2] and  [2:0][0]

========
The major differences with other range or interval libraries.

The other libraries may be interesting:
1. Boost Interval Arithmetic Library  
   http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/numeric/interval/doc/interval.htm
2. Google Guava Libraries  
   http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/RangesExplained
3. SUN C++ Interval Arithmetic Library 
   http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19422-01/819-3696/index.html

Compared with the above libraries, cppRange has following differences:

Advantages:
1. The only one supports multidimensional calculation.
   For example:
     No other library can calculate the following expressions:
     [5:0][0:-5] | [8:4][6:-3]
     [10:0][10:0] deducted by [3:0][5:5]
2. Compatible with hardware description languages which also use [high:low] ranges.
3. Provides a strict order beween range vectors (still inavailable for RangeMap objects).

Disadvantages:
1. Only support integer ranges. (no support for float/double precision ranges).
2. Open/close definition is not provided yet. (In developing)
3. No infinit support. (In developing)

========
The supported calculations:

1. valid()
   Check whther the range is a valid range.
2. empty()
   Check whether the range is empty.
3. dimension()
   Get the dimension of the range.
4. subset(), proper_subset(), superset(), proper_superset()
   Get the belonging relations between ranges.
5. overlap(), connected(), disjoint()
   Check whether two ranges are overlapped, adjacent, or disjoint.
6. equal() operator '==' and '!='
   Check two ranges are equal.
7. less() operator '>', '>=', '<=', and '<' 
   A strict order function for all range/range vector (RangeElement and Range).
8. combine() operator '|'
   Get the union of two ranges.
9. hull()
   Get the minimal ranges containing the two ranges.
10. intersection() operator '&'
   Get the shared range among two ranges.
11 complement()
   Get the remaining range when deducted by another one.
11. <<
   Print the range expression using standard output.

The support for different type of ranges

                valid() empty() dimension() subset() superset() overlap() connected() disjoint() 
RangeElement      Y       Y         N         Y          Y        Y          Y           Y
Range             Y       Y         Y         Y          Y        Y          Y           Y
RangeMap          Y       Y         Y         Y          Y        Y          N[1]        Y

-------
[1] connect() is normally used to check whether two range can be combined into a 
single range vector. Since combine() operation is always available for RangeMap, 
connected() function is useless. Also, it is difficult to define how two set of 
range vectors are adjacent.

                equal() less() combine() hull() intersection() complement() <<
RangeElement      Y       Y        Y[2]    Y          Y            Y[2]      Y
Range             Y       Y        Y[2]    Y          Y            Y[2]      Y
RangeMap          Y       N[3]     Y       N[4]       Y            Y         Y

-------
[2] When the result can not be represented, a empty range is returned. 
    For example, it is impossible to represent the result of
      [2:0] | [5:4]
    In this case, the range should be represented using RangeMap and the results will
    be stored as a set of ranges:
      {[5:4];[2:0]}
[3] It is extremely difficult to provide a strict order for RangeMap.
    Considering this exmaple
    ? {[10:3][1:0];[2:0][3:0]} > {[10][1:0];[9:8][3:0];[3:0][3:0]}
[4] hull() is used when the union of two ranges cannot be represented by a single range.
    For RangeMap, the result of combine() and hull() are always the same.
